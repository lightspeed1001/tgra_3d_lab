# 3D Lab Excercises and Final Project

Lab excercises and final project for Computer Graphics at Reykjavik University.

# Description
The main purpose of the final project was to take my earlier project and optimize it. I did this by only drawing what was needed and only check collisions for things that are very close. 
Both projects got 10/10 during grading.

## Running the project
0. Make sure you have Python3 and Pip installed
1. Install requirements from file
2. Run `Control3DProgram.py`
3. You can modify almost any parameter in the `constants.py` file
